pythonocc-core
--------------

About
-----

pythonocc is a python library whose purpose is to provide 3D modeling
features. It is intended to developers who aim at developing
CAD/PDM/PLM applications.

Latest release : [pythonocc-core 0.18.2 (february 2019)](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/releases/tag/0.18.2)

Download/install binaries
-------------------------

pythonocc provides precompiled [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/pythonocc/pythonocc-core) (they depend on third part libraries made available from the dlr-sc and conda-forge conda channels) for python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. This will get you up and running in minutes whether you run win32/win64/linux64/osx64. Here is an example for python 3.5:

```bash
# install pythonocc in the active environment with python 3.5
conda install -c conda-forge -c dlr-sc -c pythonocc -c oce pythonocc-core==0.18.2 python=3.7
```

Just replace "3.5" with "2.7" or "3.6" in the previous command to fit with your prefered python version.

Download pre-releases/development binaries
------------------------------------------

Each time a change is committed to the github repository, related binaries are uploaded to the tpaviot anaconda channel, labelled with the git development branch name.

Go and check [https://anaconda.org/tpaviot/pythonocc-core](https://anaconda.org/tpaviot/pythonocc-core).

Build from source
-----------------

oce and pythonocc
-----------------

The basis of pythonocc is a python wrapper for the 
[oce C++ library / CAD kernel](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce), aka pythonocc-core.
pythonocc-core version number matches the oce library releases its wrapping.
 
For example; the current pythonocc-core release, 0.18, requires any of the [OCE
 0.18.x](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce/releases) releases. Here, the __Major__ 
 version name of either OCE or pythonocc-core release is __0__, the __Minor__ 
 version is __18__ and the __Patch__ version is (optionally) __x__. pythonocc-core can be built with any OCE version that has a corresponding __Major__ and __Minor__ version 
 number. For example, pythonocc-core 0.18.2 can be built with OCE-0.18.1.
